"section_4_space_optimising_growth_r_1" - This is the code for the space optimising algorithm for a spatial distribution network.
The model tests four different algorithms of space optimisation. It outputs a number of analytical graphs and an animation of the network growing over timesteps. See Chapter 4 of the thesis for accompanying text which offers further explanation.
	
"Real_IIS_data_analysis" - Code to analyse real world networks when uploaded in a specific format. See Chapter 5 of the thesis for further explanation and an interpretation an examples of results creating using the analysis.

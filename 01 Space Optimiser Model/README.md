This is the code for the space optimising algorithm for a spatial distribution network.
The model tests four different algorithms of space optimisation. It outputs a number of analytical graphs and an animation of the network growing over timesteps. 

See Chapter 4 of the thesis for accompanying text which offers further explanation.

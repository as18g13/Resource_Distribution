README.md

This Appendix contains the model for Inequality in IIS with Heterogeneous Agents. The 'BATCH_SCRIPT.PY' can be used to run the simulation multiple times with changing parameters. The Parameters are stored in a separate script 'GLOBAL_PARAMETERS2.PY'

The full model code is contained within 'Section_7_Inequality_in_IIS' written in Python.

The pdf 'Chapter on Agent Heterogenity' gives a background to the model and some interesting outputs from it.
